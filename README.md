# TuwitamesAR
AR App for Tuwitames

This is a project currently being built for the Splatsin Tsm7aksaltn Society (http://splatsin.org/). 
It is based on the community play, Tuwitames (https://www.facebook.com/tuwitames/).

Recordings have been done with elders who work at the Tsm7aksaltn. 
This project is a community-based project built in collaboration with David Lacho (http://www.davidlacho.com) and key members of the Tsm7aksaltn,
such as Aaron Leon, Rosalind Williams, and the Kikia7a (Grandmothers) of Splatsin.

This project is a language revitalization augmented reality app. It uses a translation of Tuwitames into Splatsin's dialect of Secwepemcts√≠n,
which is currently endangered as it has very few speakers, all of whom are over the age of 80.

The files within this project are scripts that are being written for the Tuwitames app. This project is being built in Unity3D using the 
Vuforia AR plugin. 

The structure of the app is made so that scenes are loaded "additive" whenever a target is scanned using a mobile camera.
Once scanned, information held in the LoadSceneOnTarget script is passed to a scene manager, which handles passing dialogue settings and
character present settings to the scene. Based on the parameters set in this script, a scene can have different characters, different dialogue,
different actions, and much more. It is a very powerful script, as it handles the majority of the app's interaction.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss how this is being built, please contact me at:

Cheers!
